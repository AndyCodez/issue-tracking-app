# Issue Tracker App

This app allows for a user to sign up and raise issues. An admin assigns the issue to someone who is supposed to resolve it. The issue is marked as either "open", "in progress", "resolved", or "closed", depending on whether its stage of completion. User is notified when these changes occur via email.

##Test-Use the App
###As an Admin
Sign in using the following details<br />
username: Makatunga
password: foobar
###As a User
You can sign up using an email that you control. I, however, advice using a temporary email to avoid being spammed by other people who log in to the app as an admin.
*_Note:_ The user is automatically emailed every time their issue status changes.
More info on the functioning of the app is availed on the "help" page.
